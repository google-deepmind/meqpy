  Because renames are atomic, this avoids the problem of two processes
  attempting to copy to the same filename simultaneously, which causes
  poisoned filehandles.

  If the target path is /foo/bar.baz, the intermediate path is of the form
  /foo/bar-abcdefghi.baz.

  Args:
    from_path: path to copy from.
    to_path: path to copy to.
    immutable: Whether the file should be immutable. Setting to true allows
      replacement but no appending. It should also load slightly faster.
